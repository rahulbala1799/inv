# Cursor Rules for Inv App

## Deployment and Log Checking Rules

### MANDATORY: Always Deploy Changes to Git
- **ALWAYS** commit and push code changes to git after making modifications
- Use descriptive commit messages that explain what was changed and why
- Format: `type: Brief description` (e.g., `fix: Refresh product list after saving`)
- Include detailed explanation in commit body if needed

### MANDATORY: Always Check Vercel Logs After Deployment
- **ALWAYS** check Vercel deployment logs after pushing to git
- Wait 30-60 seconds after git push for Vercel deployment to start
- Use the script: `npm run check-logs` or `node scripts/check-vercel-logs.js`
- If VERCEL_TOKEN is not set locally, verify logs via GitHub Actions workflow
- Check for errors and verify deployment success

### Deployment Workflow
1. Make code changes
2. Test changes locally if possible
3. Stage all changes: `git add -A`
4. Commit with descriptive message: `git commit -m "type: description"`
5. Push to remote: `git push`
6. Wait 30-60 seconds for Vercel deployment
7. Check logs using the log checking script or GitHub Actions
8. Verify deployment success and check for any errors

### Code Quality
- Always check the whole program when changing code to ensure one change doesn't affect the remaining code
- Run linter checks before committing
- Fix any linting errors before deployment

### Git Commit Message Format
```
type: Brief description

Detailed explanation if needed:
- What was changed
- Why it was changed
- Any breaking changes or important notes
```

Types: `fix`, `feat`, `refactor`, `docs`, `chore`, `test`
